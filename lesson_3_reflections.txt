When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you work with other persons on a same projet, if you want to use an other computer...

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
parce que ca pourrait faire des commits a des moments non adapté.
